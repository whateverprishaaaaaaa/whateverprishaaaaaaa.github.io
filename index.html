                <p>I used to go to gym alot but would stop after a while because I don't know how to manage my time (this happens every second semester, no cap).</p>
                <p>I'm a mother of a healthy baby boy (he's a cat) and I named him Tobi just for me to call him Tobilat</p>
                <p>I am the friendliest when I'm drunk and a lot of people would agree to that.</p>
                <p>My Tatay thinks that I'm a great singer and actually told me to audition to singing competitions which I did because I know myself better (sintunado po ako).</p>
                <p>No one can take advantage of my kindness kasi 'di naman ako mabait (ilang beses na inabuso at nagpauto haha)
                <p>Lastly, dump acc to ni Kathryn Bernardo, palibhasa kasi alam na alam mo kung pano ako kunin eh isang ngiti, isang kanta, isang akap, isang sorry, wala na umiikot na ulit buong mundo ko, matalino akong tao pero pag dating sayo ewan, natatanga ako (AJ, balik ka na di na ako galit).</p>
